description: We are Supercomputing @ UCSD!

We are a sub-community of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) UC San Diego student branch, dedicated to high-performance computing specifically. 

**[>> Check out IEEE at UC San Diego!](https://ieeeucsd.org/)**

We love challenging ourselves with interesting projects in domains such as mesh networking, high-performance storage access, accelerated computing and highly-distributed applications. 

All UCSD students are welcome to join us at our workshops and projects with real applications!

*We are also hosting a GBM **this Thursday, April 13 from 6-8 PM at SDSC Auditorium!** We will talk about our plans this coming quarter and what other projects we've done. Make sure to pull through, we have pizza! üçï*
