We are Supercomputing @ UCSD, a club dedicated in all things high-performance computing (HPC). We love challenging ourselves with interesting projects in domains such as mesh networking, high-performance storage access, accelerated computing and highly-distributed applications. All UCSD students are welcome to join us at our workshops
and projects with real applications!
